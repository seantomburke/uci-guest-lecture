## Current Industry Trends

- Interviews is changing, coding interviews
- In Person, vs fully remote
- AI usage within companies
- Frontend: React, React Server Components
- Go, Python, Rust
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Cloud Architects
- Becoming more fullstack, more responsibilities

### Current trends good or bad for New Grads?
- More expectations. Not just frontend or backend, Fullstack
- With less Engineers required, the bar will rise
- Those willing to learn and adapt will win
- Creators vs Consumers
- A new grad, with AI can achieve what a Software II or Senior engineer could achieve
- Huge opportunity to teach industry professionals
- Students know more about cutting edge technology

### 3. Essential Skills for New Graduates
