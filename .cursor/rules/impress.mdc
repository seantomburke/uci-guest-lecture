This rule applies to HTML presentation files that use Impress.js for slide layout and animation. Each slide should be defined as a 'div' with the class 'step'. Proper positioning of slides is essential, using x, y, and z coordinates to create a 3D presentation flow. Ensure that each slide has appropriate size and coordinates to maintain the layout. Generally, the next slide will be positioned to the right of the current slide.
