This rule applies to HTML presentation files that use Impress.js for slide layout and animation. Each slide should be defined as a 'div' with the class 'step'. Proper positioning of slides is essential, using x, y, and z coordinates to create a 3D presentation flow. Ensure that each slide has appropriate size and coordinates to maintain the layout. Generally, the next slide will be positioned to the right of the current slide.

All header slides should exist at the same data-y location, and 3000 pixels apart left and right.

All sub slides should exist at the same data-x and be 2000 pixels apart up and down.
